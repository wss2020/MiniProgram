/**
 At some point in your coding career,
 you’ve probably come across a piece of spaghetti code that’s not so reader-friendly.
 It needed some refactoring.

 Similarly, you’ve probably also come across a coding tutorial that’s not so reader-friendly.
 Maybe you wanted to learn a new language, library, or framework,
 but the tutorial you found made you more frustrated than before.


 But they can be improved. As someone who’s written many coding tutorials,
 I realized that most coding tutorials can be refactored to be more reader-friendly—just
 like refactoring code.
