SIDE NOTE
You might be wondering: Why did we name the type parameter as “S”?

Answer: It could actually be any name, but usually people use the first letter of
a word that describes what the type is representing. In this case, I chose “S”
because it’s describing the type of a “S”tate. The following names are also common:


T (for “T”ype)
E (for “E”lement)
K (for “K”ey)
V (for “V”alue)
S (for “S”tate)
